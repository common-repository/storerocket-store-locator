You can take a look at some of our demos here: [StoreRocket Demo](https://storerocket.io/demo)

= How can I add, edit or manage my locations? =

Inside your control panel you will find our location management tool. We've built it to be easy to use and powerful at the same time. From that, you will be able to add new locations, edit the existing ones, remove the old ones, filter through them and much more.

And guess what, we have even an amazing Google Sheets sync tool to help you keep all your locations database consistent.

Our store locator widget is built with flexibility in mind. We respect that every customer has different needs and because of this we made our widget completely customizable. You will be able to easily customize the widget map styles (the colors of the map), the layout, the placeholder texts, the measurement units (kilometers and miles) and much more. If you want you can also add custom CSS to fine-tuning every little detail.
